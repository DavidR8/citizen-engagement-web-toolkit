# Cemetery Information v1


The Township of Langley has made its cemetery information available on its open data portal along with a set of published API’s which the Township self-consumes to provide a lookup tool for the public to find individuals interned at one of its three municipal cemeteries. The Township hopes that by providing this information and the corresponding API’s available, citizens and companies will be encouraged to create new services that can be consumed by the public.
